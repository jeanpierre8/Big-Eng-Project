This project was made as a part of the curriculum of the Master 2 course entitled "Data Engineering II".
In a group of 3, we worked toward creating a solid example of real-life application development in a DevOps environment.
The application is a sentiment analysis application, which analyses a piece of text and responds with the sentiment detected : either positive, negative or neutral.
<br/><br/>
The application is composed of two parts :
1. The web Interface.
2. The ML model and notebook deployed on docker.

The final application deliverable is a Docker image, that contains the pre-trained model as well as the application web interface.

Vader api was used in the model.
## Project Start:
The application should have a web interface with an input form and a submit button, where users can input their sentences, and hit submit, and the sentiment of their sentence will be presented.
